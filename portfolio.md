## Machine Learning Image Categorization Demonstration

This project involved training a machine learning model to identify several categories of bears from images. Using the fastai deep learning library, images were collected from the internet to fine tune a resnet computer vision model.

## A Memory Game in Pyscript

A memory game built simply in HTML, CSS, and Pyscript. Pyscript basically allows Python to replace Javascript for web apps, while also allowing use of certain Javascript functions to manipulate the DOM.
