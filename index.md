# About

I've always been interested in technology and science fiction. I consider myself lucky to live at a time that would seem like science fiction not too long ago. A time where we have access to a multitude of resources such as open source code, computers, and online education.

I first learned to program in college during a short stint as an engineering major. After graduating with a bachelors degree in Accounting, I continued learning about and building software (and computers) on my own. After a long stint in accounting and as an entrepreneur in the insurance business, I returned to computers through Ada Developers Academy, a year long program focused on helping more under represented folks launch careers in the tech industry.

An integral part of the Ada training program is a 5 month long internship, and I had the good fortune to intern at Amazon which was an amazing learning experience. At the end of my internship I accepted a full-time offer as a software engineer at AWS. It was a fantastic chance to learn how to deliver large scale applications with distributed backend services. In addition I was able to engage in mentoring other junior engineers. It's a treat to help other people in their software journey.

After almost 4 years at AWS/Amazon I decided to take a break to spend more time with family and decide what my next adventure would be. One recent interest is learning about large language models and generative AI systems. I've been dabbling in a few projects that can be found on my portfolio page [here](portfolio)
